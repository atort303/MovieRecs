    "# Movie Recommendation System #\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering system as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognized examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services (such as Youtube and Spotify), product recommenders for online stores (such as Amazon), or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. These systems can vary in scope/complexity. Some utilize a single type of input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books and search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The fundamental idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using \"TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset\" from Kaggle. I'll attempt to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Based on user votes, what are the highest rated movies in the entire dataset? \n",
    "2. What are some recommended movies based on the selection of a particular movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load and analyze the movie data we're working with"
